/* Thread safety
 Since count++ looks like atomic operation but it is not. Value of count is fetched, then it is incremented and
 then assigned back to the count variable. Both 2 threads try to change the value of same variable at same time, it
 cause corrupted values. We need thread safety to avoid that. There are multiple ways to achieve that
1. synchronized keyword
2. Atomic Wrapper classes (only when we have to perform atomic operation)
3. There are classes in java which are thread safe - example ConcurrentHashMap, StringBuffer
