/*
For the case when we have to extend another class apart from Thread in our class, it gets impossible because java
doesn't allows multiple inheritance. So another way of achieving multi-threading is by using interface Runnable.
Runnable interface is second way of creating thread. Using Runnable we can achieve same property of Thread.
So can implement the runnable interface and extend any class.
Runnable is functional interface which is to say it has only 1 method called run().

Runnable class do not have thread implementation within. So we make thread object by passing the object of the class
we want threads for (in main class). From there we call start() using thread object.
